| Folder Name | Description | Version | Language | Creator | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------ |
| 00_Simple_MIDI | Takes USB midi, sends it to pulse and CV outputs, also sends knob positions and CV inputs back to the computer as CC values. | 0.1 | Arduino-Pico | Tom Whitwell | Functional but WIP |
| 01_8mu_Card | Midi Host, connects to 8mu, turns accelerometer data into 4 CV outputs | 0.1 | Arduino-Pico | Tom Whitwell | Functional but WIP |
| 03_Turing_Machine | Turing Machine with tap tempo clock, 2 x pulse outputs, 4 x CV outputs | 0.1 | Arduino-Pico | Tom Whitwell | Functional but WIP |
| 04_nonlinear_dynamics |  |  |  |  |  |
| 05_chord_blimey | Generates CV/Pulse arpeggios | 0.9 | C (RPi Pico SDK) | Tom Waters | Mostly complete (for now) |

| 08_bytebeat | Generates and mangles bytebeats | 0.1 | C++/Arduino-Pico | Matt Kuebrich | Functional but WIP |
| 09_boing | Simulates the trajectories of moving particles under gravity in an enclosed space. Outputs (x, y) position to audio out, and pulses for rebounds and 'end-of-cycle'. | 0.1 | C++/Arduino-Pico | Paul Hadfield | Functional but WIP |
| 10_twists |  |  |  |  |  |
| 20_reverb | Reverb effect, plus pulse/CV generator configurable using web interface. | 0.1 | C (RPi Pico SDK) | Chris Johnson | Functional but WIP |
